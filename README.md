A Stop to the course of Separation:Or, THE SEPARATION OF THE New Separatists FROM THE PARISH CHURCHE
1. TO THE READER.

1. ERRATA.

#####Body#####

1. A Sober Answer TO THE MAIN ARGUMENTS Of the New Separatists from the Parish Churches, to stop the Course of their destructive Separation.

    _ Argument I. Such Ministers as the Scriptures command us to Avoid, and have No company with, nor so much as Eat with, are not to be joyn'd with in Church Communion as our Pastors; But those that by subscription, and open declaration to the
Church in their Ministry, do absolve all the persons in the Three Kingdoms from the obligation of Reformation, in case of very great Churchcorruptions, and justifie them all from the guilt of perjury, are such. Ergo.

      * Insinuation I. 'Tis insinuated, the Parish Churches in Presbyterian days, imposed nothing contrary to the Word of God, either upon Minister or people, but now they do.

      * Insinuation II. The Parish Churches in Presbyterian dayes were reformable in that wherin they needed Reformation; But now they have covenanted against Reformation.

      * Insinuation III. The Pastors of the Parish Churches in the Presbyterian dayes had the Power of the Keys of Government: 'Tis not so now: They were true Churches, and did own themselves for such.

      * Insinuation 4. The Presbyterian Ministers are forbidden to preach, and the people to have the Sacraments, or their children to be baptized, unless they will say and do such things as they dare not do, for fear of displeasing God: But in the Prebsyterian days, the Parish Churches then drove none such away from Ministry and Communion.

    _ Argument II.〈…〉 hold Communion with the Publick Ministers, we shall hold Communion with them in their publick Ministerial sins: It is therefore a duty to separate.

      * Insinuation I. 'Tis insinuated, the Parish Churches in Presbyterian days, imposed nothing contrary to the Word of God, either upon Minister or people, but now they do.

      * Insinuation II. The Parish Churches in Presbyterian dayes were reformable in that wherin they needed Reformation; But now they have covenanted against Reformation.

      * Insinuation III. The Pastors of the Parish Churches in the Presbyterian dayes had the Power of the Keys of Government: 'Tis not so now: They were true Churches, and did own themselves for such.

      * Insinuation 4. The Presbyterian Ministers are forbidden to preach, and the people to have the Sacraments, or their children to be baptized, unless they will say and do such things as they dare not do, for fear of displeasing God: But in the Prebsyterian days, the Parish Churches then drove none such away from Ministry and Communion.

    _ Argument III. If the Parish Churches be sill'd with Ʋsurpers, and the true Ministers thrust into Corners, then 'tis no sin to separate.

      * Insinuation I. 'Tis insinuated, the Parish Churches in Presbyterian days, imposed nothing contrary to the Word of God, either upon Minister or people, but now they do.

      * Insinuation II. The Parish Churches in Presbyterian dayes were reformable in that wherin they needed Reformation; But now they have covenanted against Reformation.

      * Insinuation III. The Pastors of the Parish Churches in the Presbyterian dayes had the Power of the Keys of Government: 'Tis not so now: They were true Churches, and did own themselves for such.

      * Insinuation 4. The Presbyterian Ministers are forbidden to preach, and the people to have the Sacraments, or their children to be baptized, unless they will say and do such things as they dare not do, for fear of displeasing God: But in the Prebsyterian days, the Parish Churches then drove none such away from Ministry and Communion.

    _ Argument IV. It is sin for Christians to be without Discipline, and a more profitable Ministry, when they may have it. The Parish Churches are without discipline, and have a less profitable Ministry. It is therefore no sin to to separate.

      * Insinuation I. 'Tis insinuated, the Parish Churches in Presbyterian days, imposed nothing contrary to the Word of God, either upon Minister or people, but now they do.

      * Insinuation II. The Parish Churches in Presbyterian dayes were reformable in that wherin they needed Reformation; But now they have covenanted against Reformation.

      * Insinuation III. The Pastors of the Parish Churches in the Presbyterian dayes had the Power of the Keys of Government: 'Tis not so now: They were true Churches, and did own themselves for such.

      * Insinuation 4. The Presbyterian Ministers are forbidden to preach, and the people to have the Sacraments, or their children to be baptized, unless they will say and do such things as they dare not do, for fear of displeasing God: But in the Prebsyterian days, the Parish Churches then drove none such away from Ministry and Communion.

    _ Argument V. If there be in one City or Country some lawful Pastors, that meet in Houses with their Flocks, and some that meet in Temples, he is the Schismatick that meeteth not with the first in Houses, being of his Charge; and he is the Schismatick that meeteth not with the other in Temples, being of his Charge; therefore to say, all must come to the Temples, or all must not, are both Schismatical Assertions.

      * Insinuation I. 'Tis insinuated, the Parish Churches in Presbyterian days, imposed nothing contrary to the Word of God, either upon Minister or people, but now they do.

      * Insinuation II. The Parish Churches in Presbyterian dayes were reformable in that wherin they needed Reformation; But now they have covenanted against Reformation.

      * Insinuation III. The Pastors of the Parish Churches in the Presbyterian dayes had the Power of the Keys of Government: 'Tis not so now: They were true Churches, and did own themselves for such.

      * Insinuation 4. The Presbyterian Ministers are forbidden to preach, and the people to have the Sacraments, or their children to be baptized, unless they will say and do such things as they dare not do, for fear of displeasing God: But in the Prebsyterian days, the Parish Churches then drove none such away from Ministry and Communion.

    _ Argument VI. Nature teacheth to hold Personal Communion with those Churches which have all Gods Ordinances, and the purest Communion, and the most lively Ministry, not medling with other men.

      * Insinuation I. 'Tis insinuated, the Parish Churches in Presbyterian days, imposed nothing contrary to the Word of God, either upon Minister or people, but now they do.

      * Insinuation II. The Parish Churches in Presbyterian dayes were reformable in that wherin they needed Reformation; But now they have covenanted against Reformation.

      * Insinuation III. The Pastors of the Parish Churches in the Presbyterian dayes had the Power of the Keys of Government: 'Tis not so now: They were true Churches, and did own themselves for such.

      * Insinuation 4. The Presbyterian Ministers are forbidden to preach, and the people to have the Sacraments, or their children to be baptized, unless they will say and do such things as they dare not do, for fear of displeasing God: But in the Prebsyterian days, the Parish Churches then drove none such away from Ministry and Communion.

    _ Argument VII. As we condemn not all the Parish Churches beside when we are but in one of them, so we condemn none of them absolutely, when we are in none of them, else the Parish Churches sinfully condemn the French and Dutch.

      * Insinuation I. 'Tis insinuated, the Parish Churches in Presbyterian days, imposed nothing contrary to the Word of God, either upon Minister or people, but now they do.

      * Insinuation II. The Parish Churches in Presbyterian dayes were reformable in that wherin they needed Reformation; But now they have covenanted against Reformation.

      * Insinuation III. The Pastors of the Parish Churches in the Presbyterian dayes had the Power of the Keys of Government: 'Tis not so now: They were true Churches, and did own themselves for such.

      * Insinuation 4. The Presbyterian Ministers are forbidden to preach, and the people to have the Sacraments, or their children to be baptized, unless they will say and do such things as they dare not do, for fear of displeasing God: But in the Prebsyterian days, the Parish Churches then drove none such away from Ministry and Communion.

    _ Argument VIII. The Temples and publick Maintenance are in the Magistrates hand, and he may give them to whom he will: And if he dispossess the lawful Pastors of them, they are bound to obey him: but they may not take themselves discharged of their Pastoral Office in relation to their Flocks. Magistrates ordain not Ministers, nor degrade them.

      * Insinuation I. 'Tis insinuated, the Parish Churches in Presbyterian days, imposed nothing contrary to the Word of God, either upon Minister or people, but now they do.

      * Insinuation II. The Parish Churches in Presbyterian dayes were reformable in that wherin they needed Reformation; But now they have covenanted against Reformation.

      * Insinuation III. The Pastors of the Parish Churches in the Presbyterian dayes had the Power of the Keys of Government: 'Tis not so now: They were true Churches, and did own themselves for such.

      * Insinuation 4. The Presbyterian Ministers are forbidden to preach, and the people to have the Sacraments, or their children to be baptized, unless they will say and do such things as they dare not do, for fear of displeasing God: But in the Prebsyterian days, the Parish Churches then drove none such away from Ministry and Communion.

    _ Argument IX. If Magistrates would appoint us unskilful Physicians for our bodies, when we can chuse better for our selves, we love our live too well, to think we should obey them: But the Magistrate hath less power to deprive us of the choice of our own best Soul Physicians, than of our Body Physicians; for that the danger of death is less terrible, than the danger of damnation.

      * Insinuation I. 'Tis insinuated, the Parish Churches in Presbyterian days, imposed nothing contrary to the Word of God, either upon Minister or people, but now they do.

      * Insinuation II. The Parish Churches in Presbyterian dayes were reformable in that wherin they needed Reformation; But now they have covenanted against Reformation.

      * Insinuation III. The Pastors of the Parish Churches in the Presbyterian dayes had the Power of the Keys of Government: 'Tis not so now: They were true Churches, and did own themselves for such.

      * Insinuation 4. The Presbyterian Ministers are forbidden to preach, and the people to have the Sacraments, or their children to be baptized, unless they will say and do such things as they dare not do, for fear of displeasing God: But in the Prebsyterian days, the Parish Churches then drove none such away from Ministry and Communion.

    _ Agument X. The new Separatists do not separate from the Parish Churches upon the same terms that some others do; viz. as being no true Churches of Christ, having no true Ministry, nor true Worship, with which communion may lawfully be held: But the Presbyterians separate to enjoy a better Ministry, Discipline, and a purer Communion, and will sometimes hold Communion with the Parish Churches, where they can have no better; so that their Separation is but like removing from one Parish
rish Church to another: 'Tis not setting up Altar against Altar.

      * Insinuation I. 'Tis insinuated, the Parish Churches in Presbyterian days, imposed nothing contrary to the Word of God, either upon Minister or people, but now they do.

      * Insinuation II. The Parish Churches in Presbyterian dayes were reformable in that wherin they needed Reformation; But now they have covenanted against Reformation.

      * Insinuation III. The Pastors of the Parish Churches in the Presbyterian dayes had the Power of the Keys of Government: 'Tis not so now: They were true Churches, and did own themselves for such.

      * Insinuation 4. The Presbyterian Ministers are forbidden to preach, and the people to have the Sacraments, or their children to be baptized, unless they will say and do such things as they dare not do, for fear of displeasing God: But in the Prebsyterian days, the Parish Churches then drove none such away from Ministry and Communion.

    _ Argument XI. The Parish Churches now, are not as they were in the times when Presbyterians cryed out of gathering Churches out of them: Therefore their sayings to the Separatists then, ought not to be reflected on, and urged against their practise now; for these reasons,
1. Because the Parish Churches then, imposed nothing upon the Minister or people contrary to the word of God, now they do.2. Because the Parish Churches then were reformable, now they have covenanted against Reformation.3. The Parish Churches then had proper Pastors, that had the power of the keys of Government, not so now.4. Because in the Parish Churches now, the Presbyterian Ministers are forbidden to preach, and the people to have the Sacrament, or their children to be baptized, unless they will say and do such things as they dare not do, for fear of Gods displeasure. The Parish Churches then drove none such away from Ministry and Communion.

      * Insinuation I. 'Tis insinuated, the Parish Churches in Presbyterian days, imposed nothing contrary to the Word of God, either upon Minister or people, but now they do.

      * Insinuation II. The Parish Churches in Presbyterian dayes were reformable in that wherin they needed Reformation; But now they have covenanted against Reformation.

      * Insinuation III. The Pastors of the Parish Churches in the Presbyterian dayes had the Power of the Keys of Government: 'Tis not so now: They were true Churches, and did own themselves for such.

      * Insinuation 4. The Presbyterian Ministers are forbidden to preach, and the people to have the Sacraments, or their children to be baptized, unless they will say and do such things as they dare not do, for fear of displeasing God: But in the Prebsyterian days, the Parish Churches then drove none such away from Ministry and Communion.

    _ Argument XII. We must distinguish between tolerable and intolerable Ministers. In some of the Parish Churches the Minister is intolerable, and not fit to be a Minister; and for this cause 'tis lawful to gather Churches.

      * Insinuation I. 'Tis insinuated, the Parish Churches in Presbyterian days, imposed nothing contrary to the Word of God, either upon Minister or people, but now they do.

      * Insinuation II. The Parish Churches in Presbyterian dayes were reformable in that wherin they needed Reformation; But now they have covenanted against Reformation.

      * Insinuation III. The Pastors of the Parish Churches in the Presbyterian dayes had the Power of the Keys of Government: 'Tis not so now: They were true Churches, and did own themselves for such.

      * Insinuation 4. The Presbyterian Ministers are forbidden to preach, and the people to have the Sacraments, or their children to be baptized, unless they will say and do such things as they dare not do, for fear of displeasing God: But in the Prebsyterian days, the Parish Churches then drove none such away from Ministry and Communion.

    _ Argument XIII. Some Parish Churches about London are grown too numerous, that all cannot come to the Parish Churches; therefore, &c.

      * Insinuation I. 'Tis insinuated, the Parish Churches in Presbyterian days, imposed nothing contrary to the Word of God, either upon Minister or people, but now they do.

      * Insinuation II. The Parish Churches in Presbyterian dayes were reformable in that wherin they needed Reformation; But now they have covenanted against Reformation.

      * Insinuation III. The Pastors of the Parish Churches in the Presbyterian dayes had the Power of the Keys of Government: 'Tis not so now: They were true Churches, and did own themselves for such.

      * Insinuation 4. The Presbyterian Ministers are forbidden to preach, and the people to have the Sacraments, or their children to be baptized, unless they will say and do such things as they dare not do, for fear of displeasing God: But in the Prebsyterian days, the Parish Churches then drove none such away from Ministry and Communion.

    _ Argument XIV. That the Conformists in the publick Temples are not enough to preach to the people, and defend them from Popery: Non-Conformists therefore ought to help, and 'tis their duty, though they gather Churches: And the Parish bounds are not of Divine Institution.

      * Insinuation I. 'Tis insinuated, the Parish Churches in Presbyterian days, imposed nothing contrary to the Word of God, either upon Minister or people, but now they do.

      * Insinuation II. The Parish Churches in Presbyterian dayes were reformable in that wherin they needed Reformation; But now they have covenanted against Reformation.

      * Insinuation III. The Pastors of the Parish Churches in the Presbyterian dayes had the Power of the Keys of Government: 'Tis not so now: They were true Churches, and did own themselves for such.

      * Insinuation 4. The Presbyterian Ministers are forbidden to preach, and the people to have the Sacraments, or their children to be baptized, unless they will say and do such things as they dare not do, for fear of displeasing God: But in the Prebsyterian days, the Parish Churches then drove none such away from Ministry and Communion.

    _ Argument XVI. We are told of separating from the Church of England, but we do not know what the Church of England is, and why it should not be as well Schism for the Parish Church Members not to frequent the Private Churches, as for the private Separate Churches not to frequent them, we know not.

      * Insinuation I. 'Tis insinuated, the Parish Churches in Presbyterian days, imposed nothing contrary to the Word of God, either upon Minister or people, but now they do.

      * Insinuation II. The Parish Churches in Presbyterian dayes were reformable in that wherin they needed Reformation; But now they have covenanted against Reformation.

      * Insinuation III. The Pastors of the Parish Churches in the Presbyterian dayes had the Power of the Keys of Government: 'Tis not so now: They were true Churches, and did own themselves for such.

      * Insinuation 4. The Presbyterian Ministers are forbidden to preach, and the people to have the Sacraments, or their children to be baptized, unless they will say and do such things as they dare not do, for fear of displeasing God: But in the Prebsyterian days, the Parish Churches then drove none such away from Ministry and Communion.

    _ Argument XVII. To desert ones Ministry is not lawful; 'tis a piece of sacriledge. We cannot preach except we have hearers, we cannot have hearers, but Members of some Parish Churches: Therefore we must gather Churches.

      * Insinuation I. 'Tis insinuated, the Parish Churches in Presbyterian days, imposed nothing contrary to the Word of God, either upon Minister or people, but now they do.

      * Insinuation II. The Parish Churches in Presbyterian dayes were reformable in that wherin they needed Reformation; But now they have covenanted against Reformation.

      * Insinuation III. The Pastors of the Parish Churches in the Presbyterian dayes had the Power of the Keys of Government: 'Tis not so now: They were true Churches, and did own themselves for such.
